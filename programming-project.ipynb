    "To develop a dataset of simulated patients attending ED with sepsis. \n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset arose from a [recent article][1] that described how an active sepsis alert system reduced inpatient mortality and morbidity on a large scale. This investigation was driven by the lack of large scale studies investigating the effectiveness of such a system. As ED is the first port of call for most patients, it may be useful to apply similar systems in such a setting. The following dataset simulates an adult ED population of a typical Irish hospital, and the number of patients with sepsis in that population.\n",

    "## Proportion of adult (>18 yrs) patients attending Irish emergency departments\n",
    "According to the Central Statistics Office (CSO), 10% of the adult Irish population who took part in the [Quarterly National Household Survey Q3 2010][1] attended an accident and emergency (A&E) department in the 12 months prior to the survey. Based on the [2016 census][2], the population of Ireland >18 years of age was estimated at 3,424,795, which equates to roughly 9,383 A&E visits across the country every day. However, a report by the [HSE in 2006][3] placed this figure closer to 3,300. For the interest of this project, we will work with a daily A&E attendance number of 3,500. \n",
    "\n",
    "Presentations to A&E are not evenly distributed across the age categories, with a bimodal presentation: 18-34, and 65+ both peaked around 13% of presentations, versus 8-9% for the other age brackets. Thus, the first parameter for our dataset, namely age, can be selected from a [beta random distribution][3], as a beta random distribution of 0,1 is similar to a bimodal distribution with peaks at either end:\n",
